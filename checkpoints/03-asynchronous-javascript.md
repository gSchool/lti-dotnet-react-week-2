### Asynchronous JavaScript

`fecth` the jokes from the [icanhazdadjoke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) and log the jokes out to the console. 

API: https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api
Fetch (Promises): https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch
Fetch (Async/Await): https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-fetch-async-await/

* As a user, I should be able to run the file from a terminal and see a joke returned.
* Write using both promises and async (same code write in both formats).
* As a stretch, as a user, I should be able to open an HTML file in the browser and click a button to get a joke. The joke should update each time I click a button.
