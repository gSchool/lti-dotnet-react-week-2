# Promises

## What are promises?

A promise is an object of anticipated completion or failure  of an asynchronous operation. The `.then()` and `.catch()` methods the get returned can be chained.

There are three states of a promise:

* pending: initial state
* fulfilled: operation has successfully completed
* rejected: operation has failed
