# Overview

You can use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.

## What is the DOM?

The DOM defines the structure of documents and how they're accessed and manipulation. The HTML DOM defines:

* elements as objects
* the properties of those elements
* the methods to access those elements
* the events those elements can have

This enables us to create, get, edit, and delete HTML elements.
