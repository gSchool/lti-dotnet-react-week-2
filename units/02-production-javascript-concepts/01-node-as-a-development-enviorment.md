# Node as a Development Enviorment

## What is Node?

Node can be used to run applications on a local machine.

# NVM, Node, and npm

NVM, or Node Version Manager, provides a simple cli that allows you to have multiple versions of Node on your machine and switch between them as necessary.

## Objectives

- Use Node on your system
- Change between multiple installations of Node
- Use `npm` to install Node packages

## Installing NVM, Node, and npm

### Mac and Linux

Mac and Linux users should follow the directions [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) to install nvm.

### Windows

Windows users should follow the directions [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades) to install nvm.

## Using NVM, Node, and npm

`nvm` will give you the ability to install multiple versions of Node on your system at a time, allowing for development in any environment.

In your command line, run `nvm install 15` followed by `node -v`, which should give you an output of `v15.xx.xx`.
